Welcome to Il2cpp Resolver But Better!

This is an enhanced fork of the existing IL2CPP Resolver by sneakyevil.

Added Features:
Renderer Support
Shader Integration
LineRenderer Support
Time Functions
Class functions for better compatibility
Dumping of object children names, parent names, and component names
Planned Features:
Raycasting
OnGui (if I can properly overload or hook the function)
AssetBundles
And more (suggestions are welcome)!
If you need any help or have questions, feel free to reach out to me: Discord: zoloz

Iâ€™m open to suggestions and improvements.
